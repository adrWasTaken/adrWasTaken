# Hey, I'm Adrian! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a student software engineer interested in using programming to create fun or useful applications. I make Minecraft plugins, chrome extensions, and am always looking to collaborate and improve my skill set. I'm experienced in Java, JS, and Python. In the future, I want to learn Angular, React, C, and Swift. Also, a PSA: You are a huge loser **unless** you use emojis in commit messages.

## ðŸ“š My Projects
My projects include an in-development Minecraft server called <a href="https://www.github.com/13QNetwork">13Q</a>, and a chrome extension called <a href="https://canvasplus.adrwas.dev">CanvasPlus.</a> You can read more about them on <a href="https://www.adrwastaken.dev">my website,</a> which, of course, is another project in and of itself.
